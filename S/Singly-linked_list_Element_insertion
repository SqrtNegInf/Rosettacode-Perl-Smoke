#p# OK
#n# the linked-list code works fine, but too lazy to format it nicely for testing

use strict;
use warnings;
use feature 'say';

# If you don't really need the constant-time insertion property of singly linked lists, just use an array. You can traverse and splice it any way.

my $A = 42;
my $B = 47;
my $C = 99;
my @l  = ($A, $B);
push @l, $C, splice @l, 1;
say my $result = "@l";

use Test::More;
is ($result, '42 99 47');
done_testing;

# However, if you really need a linked list, or all you got is an algorithm in a foreign language, you can use references to accomplish the translation.

sub insert_after {
  # first argument: node to insert after
  # second argument: node to insert
  $_[1]{next} = $_[0]{next};
  $_[0]{next} = $_[1];
}

my %B = (
    data => 42,
    next => undef, # not a circular list
);
my %A = (
    data => 47,
    next => \%B,
);
my %C = (
    data => 99,
);

#insert_after \%A, \%C;


# Note that you don't have to name your new nodes. The following works just as well:
insert_after \%A, { data => 88 };
#use DDP; p %A;

# Note the curly braces instead of round parentheses.
# It is straightforward to extend the function to take an arbitrary number of list nodes to insert:

sub insert_many_after {
  my $node = $_[0];
  my $next = $node->{next};
  shift;
  while (defined $_[0]) {
    $node->{next} = $_[0];
    $node = $node->{next};
    shift;
  }
  $node->{next} = $next;
}

# With this, it's rather easy to build a list:
my %list = ( data => 'A' );
insert_after \%list, { data => 'B' }, { data => 'C' };

#use DDP; p %list;

# List handling is simplified if the variables themselves contain references. For example:
my $list2;

# create a new list ('A'. 'B', 'C') and store it in $list2
insert_after $list2 = { data => 'A' }, { data => 'B' }, { data => 'C' };

# append two new nodes ('D', 'E') after the first element
insert_after $list2, { data => 'A2' }, { data => 'A3' };

# append new nodes ('A2a', 'A2b') after the second element (which now is 'A2')
insert_after $list2->{next}, { data => 'A2a' }, { data => 'A2b' };

#use DDP; p $list2;
