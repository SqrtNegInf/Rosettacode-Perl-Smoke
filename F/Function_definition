# The most basic form:

sub multiply1 { return $_[0] * $_[1] }
# or simply:

sub multiply2 { $_[0] * $_[1] }
# Arguments in Perl subroutines are passed in the @_ array, and they can be accessed directly, first one as $_[0], second one as $_[1], etc. When the above function is called with only one or no arguments then the missing ones have an undefined value which is converted to 0 in multiplication.
# This is an example using subroutine prototypes:

sub multiply3( $$ )
{
   my ($a, $b) = @_;
   return $a * $b;
}
# The above subroutine can only be called with exactly two scalar values (two dollar signs in the signature) but those values may be not numbers or not even defined. The @_ array is unpacked into $a and $b lexical variables, which are used later.
# The arguments can be automatically unpacked into lexical variables using the experimental signatures feature (in core as of 5.20):

use experimental 'signatures';
sub multiply4 ($x, $y) {
    return $x * $y;
}
