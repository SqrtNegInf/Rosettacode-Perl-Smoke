As sometimes (not so rarely?) happens, 'S/Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour' gave correct results, but in a different order.

Updated symlinks needed to get XML tasks working (/usr/local/lib -> /opt/local/lib), bit of a mess.

Back to zero errors (i.e. no unhandled exceptions).

'S/Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour' flapping, twice in three days.

2022-11-06
Lots of fudging after 'port' update:
cd /usr/local/lib
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libicui18n.72.1.dylib libicui18n.71.dylib
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libicuuc.72.1.dylib libicuuc.71.dylib
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libicudata.72.1.dylib libicudata.71.dylib

Alternate solution came up for 'S/Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour', see this only rarely.

Very slight changes to 'Lenna50-iMac.home.ppm'? Update reference file, see if it sticks.

Got 'S/Stream_Merge' working by 'sudo cpanm -f Heap::Simple::XS'
(even though it completely fails tests, and only actually using Heap::Simple::Perl)

And actually start making commits from iMac.

2022-10-11
Started merging changes, including variant code and output, e.g.
  H/Hostname - each host has a unique name, funny that...
  J/Juggler_sequence - do more terms, since iMac faster
  B/Bitmap_Read_an_image_through_a_pipe - use host-specific output: Lenna50-iMac.home.ppm

Pretty kludgey way to accomodate need for older Perl on Mac Pro:
cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s perl perl5.32.1

QR_decomposition        - PDL::LinearAlgebra not installing
Solving_coin_problems   - need 'maxima', waiting on a 'port' update for 'sbcl' (Steel Bank Common Lisp)

2022-10-05
Resolved two tasks:
Bilinear_interpolation              - surpress warnings, results were always OK
Bitmap_Read_an_image_through_a_pipe - just small pixel-level diffs, image eye-balls as same, so copy to 'ref'

Bailing on Gtk3 tasks. SDL needs modules installed.
Otherwise just 4 tasks still with issues.

Putting extensive notes on the process in with the main iMac migration doc.

Started work on getting smoke-testing on new iMac/Monterey.
