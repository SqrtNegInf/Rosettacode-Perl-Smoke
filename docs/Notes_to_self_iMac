Now working on enforcing v5.38 coding standards. Start with upgrading bareword file-handles.

2023-07-06
Down to zero errors. [to be clear: for install issues, not v5.38 syntax & etc]
The final two were Inline-related (and due my not taking my own advice, see 5.38 upgrade notes)
    Call_a_foreign-language_function matches
    Call_a_function_in_a_shared_library-1 matches
But RC issues, here same as onn Mac-Pro?

2023-07-05
Update of Carp::Assert fixes 'A/Assertions'.
'E/Events' worked on 2nd try, but is it stable? We shall see..
Modify testing for 'F/Find_Chess960_starting_position_identifier' (v5.36 and v5.38 results differ slightly).
Previous note about Heap::Simple::XS still applies.
'M/Multiple_regression-2' needed more results filled in (due to update in PDL?)
Installing IO::Socket::SSL gets H/HTTP* and R/Rosetta_Code* tasks working.

2023-07-04
Updated to Perl 5.38, dealing with the fallout...  Only about a dozen tasks still generating errors.

2023-06-27
Updated symlinks needed to get two XML tasks working (/usr/local/lib -> /opt/local/lib), bit of a mess.

2023-06-22
'R/Rosetta_Code_Rank_languages_by_popularity' was missing entry for 'Wren'?

2023-05-31
Two errors at once, what's that about?
M/Multiton
M/Metered_concurrency

2023-05-23
Once again, 'S/Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour' gave correct results, but in a different order.

2023-05-17
As sometimes (not so rarely?) happens, 'S/Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour' gave correct results, but in a different order.

Back to zero errors (i.e. no unhandled exceptions).

2022-11-30
'S/Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour' flapping, twice in three days.

2022-11-06
Lots of fudging after 'port' update:
cd /usr/local/lib
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libicui18n.72.1.dylib libicui18n.71.dylib
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libicuuc.72.1.dylib libicuuc.71.dylib
ln -s /opt/local/lib/libicudata.72.1.dylib libicudata.71.dylib

2022-11-03
Alternate solution came up for 'S/Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour', see this only rarely.

2022-10-19
Very slight changes to 'Lenna50-iMac.home.ppm'? Update reference file, see if it sticks.

2022-10-18
Got 'S/Stream_Merge' working by 'sudo cpanm -f Heap::Simple::XS'
(even though it completely fails tests, and only actually using Heap::Simple::Perl)

2022-10-12
And actually start making commits from iMac.

2022-10-11
Started merging changes, including variant code and output, e.g.
  H/Hostname - each host has a unique name, funny that...
  J/Juggler_sequence - do more terms, since iMac faster
  B/Bitmap_Read_an_image_through_a_pipe - use host-specific output: Lenna50-iMac.home.ppm

2022-10-09
Pretty kludgey way to accomodate need for older Perl on Mac Pro:
cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s perl perl5.32.1

2022-10-06
QR_decomposition        - PDL::LinearAlgebra not installing
Solving_coin_problems   - need 'maxima', waiting on a 'port' update for 'sbcl' (Steel Bank Common Lisp)

2022-10-05
Resolved two tasks:
Bilinear_interpolation              - surpress warnings, results were always OK
Bitmap_Read_an_image_through_a_pipe - just small pixel-level diffs, image eye-balls as same, so copy to 'ref'

2022-10-04
Bailing on Gtk3 tasks. SDL needs modules installed.
Otherwise just 4 tasks still with issues.

2022-10-03
Putting extensive notes on the process in with the main iMac migration doc.

2022-10-01
Started work on getting smoke-testing on new iMac/Monterey.
