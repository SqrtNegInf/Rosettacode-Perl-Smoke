Getting to be a pattern, 'S/Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour' gave correct results, but in a different order.
HTTPS failed too, one-off?

Start with cloning repository:
    git clone git://github.com/SqrtNegInf/Rosettacode-Perl-Smoke.git

===== Pre-flight =====

Libraries needed for modules/tools:
    sudo apt-get install pcregrep ack libssl-dev                     # general
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev                                  # security
    sudo apt-get install imagemagick libmagickwand-dev libimlib2-dev # image
    sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev           # math
    sudo apt-get install sbcl maxima                                 # Lisp tool

Custom Perl
    perlbrew install perl-5.36.0 -Dusethreads -Duseshrplib
    perlbrew install-cpanm

Perl modules (some extra fiddling required, grep doesn't get everything needed)
    rgrep '^use [A-Z]' [0-Z] | pf 's/^.*:use //; s/[; ].*$//' | sort -u | pf 's/^/cpanm /' > modules.sh
    source modules.sh
    cpanm enum builtins 
    cpanm Math::BigInt::GMP Filter::Simple IO::Socket::SSL LWP::Protocol::https DBD::SQLite Inline::C
    cpanm Class::Spiffy MooseX::Storage Role::Multiton

S/Stream_Merge requires this:
    cpam --force Heap::Simple::XS

E/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm is the final piece:
    curl -O http://backpan.cpantesters.org/authors/id/B/BR/BRIANC/Math-EllipticCurve-Prime-0.003.tar.gz
    tar zxf Math-EllipticCurve-Prime-0.003.tar.gz
    (cd Math-EllipticCurve-Prime-0.003/; perl Makefile.PL; make install)
    cpanm Crypt::EC_DSA

Some directories that aren't in git repository
    mkdir tmp run ref/test/dir3 exp meta-i

Fake an older Perl (used on Mac-Pro)
    (cd /usr/local/bin; sudo ln -s perl perl5.32.1) 

Home-grown tools:
    (cd ~; scp -pr imac:bin .)
