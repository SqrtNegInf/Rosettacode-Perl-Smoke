NB: These run for a very long time if proper Math::* modules not installed

    W/Wolstenholme_numbers

=====

The biggest hitch this time:

Installing 'homebrew' put a version of 'pkg-config' at '/usr/local/bin', hid '/opt/local/bin/pkg-config' (the latter
having all the info on MacPorts packages). Solved by:

cd /usr/local/bin; mv pkg-config pkg-config-homebrew

After that many fewer issues. Of course now Homebrew might have problems...

An old issue worth noting again:

Image::Imlib2 needs by-hand massaging of 'Build.PL' file.  Saving it at '$HOME/.cpan' in a .tar.gz, not 
updating that distribution, so it should work again for 'perl-5.40' next year, and etc.

---

To find modules needing installing:

g -h locate bench/last/*out | pf 's/^.*need to install the //;s/ .*$//' | g -v 'Can.t' | sort -u | pf 's/^/sudo cpanm /' > run.sh

A couple by-hand items, probably only the first group actually needed to be done, if I had just kept iterating on
'run.sh', they would have been automatically installed.

sudo cpanm --force DateTime
sudo cpanm --force Imager
sudo cpanm -n -f PDF::LiteF
sudo cpanm IO::Socket::SSL

sudo cpanm Sub::Identity
sudo cpanm Math::GMPq
sudo cpanm Math::MPC
sudo cpanm Math::BigInt::GMP
