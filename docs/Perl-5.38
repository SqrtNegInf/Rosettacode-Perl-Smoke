NB: These run for a very long time if proper Math::* modules not installed

=====

The biggest hitch this time:

Installing 'homebrew' put a version of 'pkg-config' at '/usr/local/bin', hid '/opt/local/bin/pkg-config' (the latter
having all the info on MacPorts packages). Solved by:

cd /usr/local/bin; mv pkg-config pkg-config-homebrew

After that many fewer issues. Of course now Homebrew will have problems...

---

An old issue worth noting again:

Image::Imlib2 needs by-hand massaging of 'Build.PL' file.  Saving it at '$HOME/.cpan' in a .tar.gz, not 
updating that distribution, so it should work again for 'perl-5.40' next year, and etc.

---

Functions using Inline::* are the canary in the coal mine for proper upgrade/module hygiene:
    Call_a_foreign-language_function
    Call_a_function_in_a_shared_library-1

mkdir ~/PL-safe; mkdir ~/PL-safe/site_perl; 
cd /usr/local/lib/perl5
sudo mv 5.36.0 ~/PL-safe
sudo mv site_perl/5.36.0 ~/PL-safe/site_perl
===> now do all the module installs <===
sudo mv ~/PL-safe/5.36.0 .
sudo mv ~/PL-safe/site_perl/5.36.0 site_perl
rm -rf ~/PL-safe

This way modules never have conflicts with XS and so on. The current distribution would work even if the 
previous were to be entirely wiped from the disk.

---

To find modules needing installing:

g -h locate bench/last/*out | pf 's/^.*need to install the //;s/ .*$//' | g -v 'Can.t' | sort -u | pf 's/^/sudo cpanm /' > run.sh

A couple by-hand items, probably only the first group actually needed to be done, if I had just kept iterating on
'run.sh', they would have been automatically installed.

sudo cpanm --force DateTime
sudo cpanm --force Imager
sudo cpanm -n -f PDF::LiteF
sudo cpanm IO::Socket::SSL

sudo cpanm Sub::Identity
sudo cpanm Math::GMPq
sudo cpanm Math::MPC
sudo cpanm Math::BigInt::GMP

# special PWC modules
sudo cpanm Term::Table; #(cf note below)
sudo cpanm --force Math::Calc::Parser Tie::Hash::Indexed DateTime 

# trouble:
Term::Table is a dependency of Struct::Dumb (and String::Pad?), but not properly flagged as one
Inline @ 029/2 - move 5.36 stuff temporarily?
Tree::Suffix force install, segv on run [128/1/adam-russell.pl]
Math::GSL::Permutation - config failed [089/2/adam-russell.pl]
