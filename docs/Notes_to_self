A few stumbles later... Everything seems to work?

Installed blead Perl and did a syntax check on all tasks.  Modulo failed package installs (Gtk3 because of Cairo issues, which
in theory I know how to fix but am too lazy...), no errors.  TODO: actually run the code.

Shamed online--ohh the ignominy--by Trizen (?), added 'use strict' and 'use warnings' to all non-trivial tasks.  Made solemn 
vow to use in all future RC updates. A few instances of 'no warnings' needed when the code relied heavily on lazy programmer 
Perl magic (hey, I resemble that remark).

First commit. This should go quickly, done by Christmas?  :-)
