Drifting further and further from RC in capitalization of tasks, oh well.

2022-01-22
Look for OEIS citations in the Raku RC code, not here

2022-01-21
'while (1)' === 'while ()', about usage split 50/50 in code

2022-01-17
'Rosetta_Code_Rank_languages_by_number_of_users' failed?
p.s. OK next day.

2022-01-12
Now going to stress about it, just test one (of two) examples in 'Dominoes'

2021-11-17
How to test 'Dominoes'?

2021-11-15
Speed jump in testing will be due to lowered limit in 'Iterated_digits_squaring', not any special Perl magic...

2021-11-08
At this point failures in all tasks using LWP, new recently:
HTTPS
Web_scraping

Probably has to do with OpenSSL versions, but attempts to update IO::Socket::SSL fail, just gobbles memory

2021-04-24
Sometimes can reduce to just 'reverse', but not always: join '', reverse split '' 

2021-04-11
RC site still flakey, bail on testing while not around to fiddle with it.

2021-04-05
RC site is off-line again, so skipping smoke testing.

2021-04-03
RC site is off-line, so skipping smoke testing.

2021-03-23
Continuing administrivia: finding tasks incorrectly marked bad/missing, bumping up task count to true value

2021-03-22
Catch up on missing 'primes' tasks (but missed 'Strange_unique_prime_triplets')

2021-03-07
What's the difference between 'for' and 'foreach'?  4 letters...  Used almost 300 times.

2021-03-06
'MAC_Vendor_Lookup' still not working? Broke around Feb 20th.  What changed?

2021-02-23
Are there cases where double-quotes cannot be replaced by single? (aside from obvious uses in interpolation, etc)

2021-02-21
To find the one-liner for table formatting: grep-raku 'print.*n/gr'

2021-01-18
I was blind, but thanks to trizen++ I now see (why Pseudo-random classes weren't working right).  Big D'oh.

2020-11-17
Chess_player is just too much...

2020-11-08
Renamed some tasks, following revsions on RC by thundergnat++

2020-11-07
thundergnat++ rationalization of task names required two minor testing updates.

2020-10-12
The CPAN autobundle for this date reflects a 100% functioning RC (plus local stuff)

2020-10-11
'Cwd.pm' mis-match error solved by removing auto-generated '_Inline' directory, duh.
NB: LWP::Protocol::https requires a separate install from libwww-perl aka LWP
Useful tools/techniques:
   cpan -a / PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Snapshot_2020_10_11_00'
   perl -MCPAN -e 'recompile()'

For Perl/Path/SMILES/Depict/QSAR:
cd /usr/local/perllib/BB/$dir; rm Makefile; perl Makefile.PL; sudo make install

Can abandon: Archive::Zip, HTML::Tree

Also: Pays to check CPAN mirror site list once every so often, primary was very stale...

2020-10-10
Oops, forget I was using 'brew' for image libraries, but 'macports' as well, so strenuous efforts needed to 
get the right mix of headers and libraries. 
Also revealed I was skipping testing on P/Plot_coordinate_pairs for no reason, it works fine.

2020-10-03
Stuck on 'Imager' install. SVG problems were trivial (version #)  
'bigint' issues solved with: sudo cpanm --uninstall Math::BigInt::Lite

2020-10-02
Upgraded to the current release of Perl. Should just go with 'cpanm --force' for all modules 
(needed for quite a few: Data::Locations Heap::Simple::XS, PDL::LinearAlgebra, etc.)

2020-08-28
'cpan -i Crypt::EC_DSA' failed, had to download and install this by hand first:
curl -O http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/B/BR/BRIANC/Math-EllipticCurve-Prime-0.003.tar.gz

2020-03-02
Never install Math::BigInt::Lite!  Screws up tasks that need for-real 'bigint'.

2020-03-01
Gotta start playing catch-up, or be over-taken by Python (O the horror!)

2020-01-24
Experimental fiddling with code (postderef, scalar) but not worth updating on RC

2020-01-03
Trivial but annoying: fixed 'blank' lines to become true paragraphs

2019-10-04
Good ref: https://floating-point-gui.de/languages/perl/

2019-09-22
Should 'shelling out' count as a task solution?  Not for me, at least.

2019-09-21
Added two audio tasks, and determined my upper freq. hearing is shot (Oscar could hear ~ 3000 hz higher, and so could Pippin)

2019-09-10
Only program change involved a spurious, but useful, warning about '$#' (they were just characters in a string)

2019-09-09
Finally upgrading to 5.30, some difficulties in the process.

2019-09-02
Racket and Perl neck and neck, over-taking Kotlin on the outside lane... (wait, not a race!)

2019-08-25
Summer break over, do all those number sequence tasks...

2019-05-13
Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour gave an alternate answer, why? (stowed in 'tmp/Holy-tour-alternate')

2019-05-04
Did 'Magic_squares' tasks like P6, leading me to make 1st SO inquiry: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55994128/

2019-05-02
tackled meta-Rosetta tasks, but leaving the two biggest alone (P6 covers well enough)

2019-04-24
Updated to perl5.28.2 yesteday, mass update of CPAN modules today; no RC tasks failed.

2019-04-20
A nudge on Feigenbaum from Trizen, and here I thought I was done...

2019-04-06
A few stumbles later... Everything seems to work OK.  A 15-th place rounding difference, stuff like that.  Imager 
library didn't work, but not likely a ongoing problem. The May release should be a breeze (famous last words).

2019-04-05
Installed blead Perl and did a syntax check on all tasks.  Modulo failed package installs (Gtk3 because of Cairo 
issues, which in theory I know how to fix but am too lazy...), no errors.  TODO: actually run the code.

2019-04-03
Was missing contributions from 'Tybalt89', because the summary lines never managed to mention Perl.

2019-04-02
Ran code coverage tests, nearly 100%. Got pretty much what you'd expect given how narrowly tasks are written.

2019-04-01
Another rewrite, but this time left old version, for comparison (Determine_if_two_triangles_overlap).

2019-03-31
Again: Complete rewrite of two Parse/RPN tasks; this is kosher, right?

2019-03-21
Complete rewrite of 'The_Name_Game' ("same logic, more idiomatic"), hope author doesn't mind.

2019-03-16
Chided for my sloppiness--oh the ignominy--by Trizen (?), added 'use strict' and 'use warnings' to all 
non-trivial tasks. Made solemn vow to use them in all future RC updates. A few instances of 'no warnings'
needed when the code relied heavily on lazy programmer Perl magic (hey, I resemble that remark).

2019-02-26
Added a Fortran example (hope no one notices, my secret shame).  Wraps up Feigenbaum, not doing more with it.

2019-01-13
Break over, time to get back in the hamster wheel.

2018-11-04
Pretty slack about 'library' tag, but will make sure I tag 'ntheory', because it's the greatest (and the author 
wants to ensure it's being used optimally).

2018-10-29
As with P6 smoking archive, move tasks to alphabetical sub-directories. Github unhappy with too many files in dir.

2018-10-10
Woo-hoo, Perl now in top 10. Not that's it's a pissing contest, no not that at all...

2018-08-25
Wrapping up initial pass of adding existing tasks to smoke testing.

2018-07-05
Automated smoke-testing of blead perl -- ensure .30 release well-tested on an older MacOS

2018-06-30
First commit. This should go quickly, done by Christmas?  :-)
