Gotta start playing catch-up, or be over-taken by Python (O the horror!)

2020-01-24
Experimental fiddling with code (postderef, scalar) but not worth updating on RC

2020-01-03
Trivial but annoying: fixed 'blank' lines to become true paragraphs

2019-10-04
Good ref: https://floating-point-gui.de/languages/perl/

2019-09-22
Should 'shelling out' count as a task solution?  Not for me, at least.

2019-09-21
Added two audio tasks, and determined my upper freq. hearing is shot (Oscar could hear ~ 3000 hz higher, and so could Pippin)

2019-09-10
Only program change involved a spurious, but useful, warning about '$#' (they were just characters in a string)

2019-09-09
Finally upgrading to 5.30, some difficulties in the process.

2019-09-02
Racket and Perl neck and neck, over-taking Kotlin on the outside lane... (wait, not a race!)

2019-08-25
Summer break over, do all those number sequence tasks...

2019-05-13
Solve_a_Holy_Knight%27s_tour gave an alternate answer, why? (stowed in 'tmp/Holy-tour-alternate')

2019-05-04
Did 'Magic_squares' tasks like P6, leading me to make 1st SO inquiry: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55994128/

2019-05-02
tackled meta-Rosetta tasks, but leaving the two biggest alone (P6 covers well enough)

2019-04-24
Updated to perl5.28.2 yesteday, mass update of CPAN modules today; no RC tasks failed.

2019-04-20
A nudge on Feigenbaum from Trizen, and here I thought I was done...

2019-04-06
A few stumbles later... Everything seems to work OK.  A 15-th place rounding difference, stuff like that.  Imager 
library didn't work, but not likely a ongoing problem. The May release should be a breeze (famous last words).

2019-04-05
Installed blead Perl and did a syntax check on all tasks.  Modulo failed package installs (Gtk3 because of Cairo 
issues, which in theory I know how to fix but am too lazy...), no errors.  TODO: actually run the code.

2019-04-03
Was missing contributions from 'Tybalt89', because the summary lines never managed to mention Perl.

2019-04-02
Ran code coverage tests, nearly 100%. Got pretty much what you'd expect given how narrowly tasks are written.

2019-04-01
Another rewrite, but this time left old version, for comparison (Determine_if_two_triangles_overlap).

2019-03-31
Again: Complete rewrite of two Parse/RPN tasks; this is kosher, right?

2019-03-21
Complete rewrite of 'The_Name_Game' ("same logic, more idiomatic"), hope author doesn't mind.

2019-03-16
Chided for my sloppiness--oh the ignominy--by Trizen (?), added 'use strict' and 'use warnings' to all 
non-trivial tasks. Made solemn vow to use them in all future RC updates. A few instances of 'no warnings'
needed when the code relied heavily on lazy programmer Perl magic (hey, I resemble that remark).

2019-02-26
Added a Fortran example (hope no one notices, my secret shame).  Wraps up Feigenbaum, not doing more with it.

2019-01-13
Break over, time to get back in the hamster wheel.

2018-11-04
Pretty slack about 'library' tag, but will make sure I tag 'ntheory', because it's the greatest (and the author 
wants to ensure it's being used optimally).

2018-10-29
As with P6 smoking archive, move tasks to alphabetical sub-directories. Github unhappy with too many files in dir.

2018-10-10
Woo-hoo, Perl now in top 10. Not that's it's a pissing contest, no not that at all...

2018-08-25
Wrapping up initial pass of adding existing tasks to smoke testing.

2018-07-05
Automated smoke-testing of blead perl -- ensure .30 release well-tested on an older MacOS

2018-06-30
First commit. This should go quickly, done by Christmas?  :-)
