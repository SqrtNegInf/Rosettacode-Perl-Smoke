# incorrect:
# (Foo->new) x $n;
# here Foo->new can be any expression that returns a reference representing
# a new object
# which is incorrect since Foo->new is only evaluated once.

# A correct version is:
# map { Foo->new } 1 .. $n;
# which evaluates Foo->new $n times and collects each result in a list.
