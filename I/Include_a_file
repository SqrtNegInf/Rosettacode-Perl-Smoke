# Here we include the file include.pl into our main program:
#main.perl:

# #!/usr/bin/perl
do "include.pl";        # Utilize source from another file
sayhello();

# include.pl:

sub sayhello {
  print "Hello World!";
}
# From documentation:If "do" cannot read the file, it returns undef and sets $! to the error.
# If "do" can read the file but cannot compile it, it returns undef and sets
# an error message in [email protected]
# If the file is successfully compiled, "do" returns the value of the last
# expression evaluated.
