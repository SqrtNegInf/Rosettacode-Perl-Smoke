# Uses the qx{} construct (which is a synonym for backticks, e.g. `command`) to execute a given command and redirect its output.
# A (somewhat contrived*) example, capturing only STDOUT:

my @directories = grep { chomp; -d } `ls`;
for (@directories) {
    $result .= "$_\n";
}

# Perl's opendir function should be used in preference to parsing ls--it's safer, faster, and more portable.
# Perl also honors shell redirections:

#my $command = shift or die "No command supplied\n";
$command = 'uname';
my @output_and_errors = qx/$command 2>&1/ or die "Couldn't execute command\n";
$result .= shift @output_and_errors;

# qx// is implemented internally with the built-in function readpipe, which can be invoked directly as readpipe EXPR (where EXPR is some command) and assigned to scalars or lists just like qx/command/ or `command`.
# The open command can also be used to open pipes using the -| mode:

use autodie;
my $enc = ':encoding(UTF-8)';
my $child_pid = open(my $pipe, "-|$enc", 'ls A');
while (<$pipe>) {
  # Print all files whose names are all lowercase
    $result .= $_ if m/^Array/;
}

say $result;
